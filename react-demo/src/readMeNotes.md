## Component: Props & State

### Props

- keyword in React that passes data from one component to another. But the important part here is that data with props are being passed in a unidirectional flow.  This means it’s passed one way from parent to child.

- read-only data, which means that data coming from the parent shouldn’t be changed by child components.

```props
1. Define an attribute and its value (data).
2. Pass it to the child component by using props.
3. Render the props data.

```

### Recap
* Props stand for properties and is a special keyword in React.
* Props are being passed to components like function arguments.
* Props can only be passed to components in one way (parent to child).
* Props data is immutable (read-only).
